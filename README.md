  "TitanicSynopsis": "James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line 
   and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death 
   in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912."
  "favoriteseries": "Friends",
  "FriendsSynopsis": "Six young men and women live in the same apartment complex and face life and love together in Manhattan, New York City. As they're constantly sticking their noses 
   into each another's businesses, as well as sometimes swapping romantic partners, the group always get into the kind of comic situations that most other people never experience, 
   especially during breakups."'
